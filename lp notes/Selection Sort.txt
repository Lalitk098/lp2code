SELECTION SORT



Certainly! Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by dividing the input into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how Selection Sort works:

1. Imagine you have an unsorted list of numbers.
2. The algorithm starts by considering the entire list as the unsorted part.
3. It then searches for the smallest (or largest) element in the unsorted part.
4. Once the smallest (or largest) element is found, it swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part. This effectively moves the selected element to the sorted part.
5. Now, the algorithm considers the remaining portion of the list (excluding the element that has just been sorted) as the new unsorted part.
6. Steps 3 to 5 are repeated for the new unsorted part until the entire list becomes sorted.

To illustrate this with an example, let's say we have the following unsorted list of numbers: [7, 3, 1, 5, 9, 2].

1. The smallest element in the unsorted part is 1. It is swapped with the first element, resulting in: [1, 3, 7, 5, 9, 2].
2. The new unsorted part is [3, 7, 5, 9, 2].
3. The smallest element in the new unsorted part is 2. It is swapped with the second element, resulting in: [1, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3].
4. The new unsorted part is [7, 5, 9, 3].
5. The smallest element in the new unsorted part is 3. It is swapped with the third element, resulting in: [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 7].
6. The new unsorted part is [5, 9, 7].
7. The smallest element in the new unsorted part is 5. It is swapped with the fourth element, resulting in: [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 7].
8. The new unsorted part is [9, 7].
9. The smallest element in the new unsorted part is 7. It is swapped with the fifth element, resulting in: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9].
10. The new unsorted part is [9].
11. Since there's only one element left in the unsorted part, the algorithm stops.

The final sorted list is [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9].

Selection Sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm, especially for large lists, as its time complexity is O(n^2). However, it is simple to understand and implement, making it useful for small lists or as a basic educational example of sorting algorithms.

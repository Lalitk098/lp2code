RSA algorithm



Certainly! RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm named after its inventors. Unlike symmetric encryption algorithms, which use a single shared key for both encryption and decryption, RSA employs a pair of keys: a public key and a private key.

Here's a simplified explanation of how RSA works:

Key Generation:
1. Choose two distinct prime numbers, p and q.
2. Compute the product of these primes, n = p * q. This forms the modulus for both the public and private keys.
3. Calculate Euler's totient function, φ(n), which is the number of positive integers less than n that are coprime (do not share any common factors) with n.
4. Select a value for the public exponent, e, such that 1 < e < φ(n), and e is coprime with φ(n). This forms the public key (n, e).
5. Compute the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo φ(n), resulting in the private exponent, d. This forms the private key (n, d).

Encryption:
1. Convert the plaintext message into a numerical representation.
2. Use the recipient's public key (n, e) to perform modular exponentiation on the numerical representation of the plaintext. The ciphertext is computed as c = (plaintext^e) mod n.

Decryption:
1. Use the recipient's private key (n, d) to perform modular exponentiation on the ciphertext. The original plaintext is recovered as plaintext = (ciphertext^d) mod n.

The security of RSA is based on the computational difficulty of factoring large composite numbers into their prime factors. The prime factors of the modulus, n, are required to determine the private key from the public key. If the prime factors cannot be efficiently determined, RSA remains secure.

RSA is widely used in various applications, including secure communication protocols, digital signatures, and key exchange protocols. It provides a means for secure communication between two parties who have not previously shared any secret information.
